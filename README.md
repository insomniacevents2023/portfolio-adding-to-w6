Adding to Week 6 exercise of my Favorite series using React 

I created there sub directories inside of componenets.

Each directory has an index.js

I used the the Tv show/series exercise and the menu application as well.

I added additonal content to each index. 

images and information are scattered through out

I also added a like and dislike button with a counter.

Links to and from are also added to navigate across the pages seemlesly
